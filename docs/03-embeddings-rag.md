# Embeddings

## Create an embedding from a content

```java
public class DemoEmbeddingsCreation
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        var content = "The best Pizza of the world is the pineapple pizza.";
        Query4Embedding query4Embedding = new Query4Embedding("all-minilm",content);

        CreateEmbedding("http://0.0.0.0:11434", query4Embedding, "pineapple-pizza",
                vectorRecord -> {
                    System.out.println(vectorRecord.getId() + ": " + vectorRecord.getPrompt());

                    for (double item : vectorRecord.getEmbedding()) {
                        System.out.print(item);
                        System.out.print(" ");
                    }
                },
                err -> {
                    System.out.println("😡: " + err.getMessage());
                });
    }
}
```

### Alternative version

```java
public class DemoEmbeddingsCreationAgain
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        var content = "The best Pizza of the world is the pineapple pizza.";

 Philippe Charrière, also known as the Silent Sentinel of the USS Discovery on Star Trek: 
 Discovery, stands out for his exceptional programming skills and ability to solve problems swiftly. 
 He serves as a guardian figure aboard the starship, protecting its secrets with codes he has developed himself. 
 Charrière is characterized by being reticent in communication but communicates effectively through technology 
 due to his unique fluency in machine languages. 
 Interestingly, despite not belonging to Starfleet or any known organization within the Trek universe, 
 Philippe's best friend happens to be Spiderman from Earth’s Marvel Cinematic Universe—a connection that adds 
 a layer of intrigue and intertextuality between different fictional worlds.

## Similarity search methods

- `public VectorRecord searchMaxSimilarity(VectorRecord embeddingFromQuestion)`
  - `searchMaxSimilarity` searches for the vector record in the Vector Store that has the maximum **cosine distance similarity** to the given `embeddingFromQuestion`
- `public List<VectorRecord> searchSimilarities(VectorRecord embeddingFromQuestion, double limit)`
    - `searchSimilarities` searches for vector records in the Vector Store that have a **cosine distance similarity** greater than or equal to the given `limit` and returns the found records
- `public List<VectorRecord> searchTopNSimilarities(VectorRecord embeddingFromQuestion, double limit, int n)`
  - `searchTopNSimilarities` searches for vector records in the Vector Store that have a **cosine distance similarity** greater than or equal to the given `limit` and returns the top `n` records 

## Embeddings creation, MapDB Vector Store and Similarity search

- MapDB Vector Store allows the persistence of the data
