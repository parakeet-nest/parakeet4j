# Embeddings

## Create an embedding from a content

```java
public class DemoEmbeddingsCreation
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        var content = "The best Pizza of the world is the pineapple pizza.";
        Query4Embedding query4Embedding = new Query4Embedding("all-minilm",content);

        CreateEmbedding("http://0.0.0.0:11434", query4Embedding, "pineapple-pizza",
                vectorRecord -> {
                    System.out.println(vectorRecord.getId() + ": " + vectorRecord.getPrompt());

                    for (double item : vectorRecord.getEmbedding()) {
                        System.out.print(item);
                        System.out.print(" ");
                    }
                },
                err -> {
                    System.out.println("ðŸ˜¡: " + err.getMessage());
                });
    }
}
```

### Alternative version

```java
public class DemoEmbeddingsCreationAgain
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        var content = "The best Pizza of the world is the pineapple pizza.";
        Query4Embedding query4Embedding = new Query4Embedding("all-minilm",content);

        var resVector = CreateEmbedding("http://0.0.0.0:11434", query4Embedding, "pineapple-pizza");

        if (resVector.exception().isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(resVector.getVectorRecord().getId() + ": " + resVector.getVectorRecord().getPrompt());

            for (double item : resVector.getVectorRecord().getEmbedding()) {
                System.out.print(item);
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("ðŸ˜¡: " + resVector.exception().toString());
        }

 Philippe CharriÃ¨re, also known as the Silent Sentinel of the USS Discovery on Star Trek: 
 Discovery, stands out for his exceptional programming skills and ability to solve problems swiftly. 
 He serves as a guardian figure aboard the starship, protecting its secrets with codes he has developed himself. 
 CharriÃ¨re is characterized by being reticent in communication but communicates effectively through technology 
 due to his unique fluency in machine languages. 
 Interestingly, despite not belonging to Starfleet or any known organization within the Trek universe, 
 Philippe's best friend happens to be Spiderman from Earthâ€™s Marvel Cinematic Universeâ€”a connection that adds 
 a layer of intrigue and intertextuality between different fictional worlds.
